# Global Energy Sustainability Analysis Project
*A Decision Intelligence Approach to Understanding SDG 7*

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes global energy security through the lens of UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7). Using comprehensive datasets from international organizations, we aim to identify patterns, predict trends, and recommend interventions to improve energy access, affordability, and sustainability worldwide. Our analysis integrates traditional statistical methods with advanced machine learning techniques to uncover insights into energy production, carbon emissions, and consumer costs.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Carbon Intensity of Energy (CIE)**
   - Definition: Average CO₂ emissions per megawatt-hour (MWh) for each energy source.
   - Target: Reduce global average carbon intensity to below 100 kg CO₂/MWh by 2035.
   - Baseline: Current global average ~400 kg CO₂/MWh.
   - Monitoring: Annual assessment using national energy production and emissions data.

2. **Energy Affordability Index (EAI)**
   - Definition: Percentage of household income spent on electricity.
   - Target: Ensure energy costs remain below 5% of median household income in all regions.
   - Baseline: Varies by region; low-income households often exceed 10%.
   - Monitoring: Quarterly review based on consumer energy prices and income levels.

3. **Renewable Energy Penetration Rate (REPR)**
   - Definition: Percentage of total electricity generation sourced from renewables (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).
   - Target: Increase renewable energy share to 60% of global electricity production by 2040.
   - Baseline: 29% as of 2023.
   - Monitoring: Annual review of national energy production statistics.

4. **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) Benchmarking**
   - Definition: Comparison of LCOE (cost per MWh) across different energy sources, adjusted for subsidies and infrastructure costs.
   - Target: Reduce LCOE for renewables to below fossil fuel costs in all regions.
   - Baseline: Solar ($40/MWh), Wind ($35/MWh), Natural Gas ($60/MWh), Coal ($80/MWh).
   - Monitoring: Bi-annual cost analysis based on infrastructure investments and fuel prices.

5. **Energy Access Rate (EAR)**
   - Definition: Percentage of the population with reliable electricity access.
   - Target: 100% global electricity access by 2030.
   - Baseline: 90% as of 2023, with over 750 million people lacking access.
   - Monitoring: Annual tracking using World Bank and IEA data.
