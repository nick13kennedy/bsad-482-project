# Understanding Global Energy Production: Carbon Emissions, Costs, and Consumer Impact
*A Decision Intelligence Analysis of SDG 7*

## Problem Context
Energy production directly influences economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social development. However, the choice of energy source presents critical trade-offs in terms of carbon emissions, production costs, and consumer affordability. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG 7) aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. Yet, as of 2023, more than 750 million people worldwide still lack access to electricity, with significant disparities between high-income and developing regions[[1]](#1). Additionally the areas of the world that do have access to power comes from nonrenewable sources that have damaging effects on the environment.

The energy sector remains the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, responsible for approximately 73% of total emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion [[2]](#2). Meanwhile, advancements in renewable energy and nuclear power offer low-emission alternatives but come with challenges related to infrastructure investment, energy storage, and policy support. Understanding the comparative impact of different energy sources is essential for balancing economic feasibility with sustainability goals. With many options for alternative energy sources such as nuclear energy that does not produce carbon emissions [[3]](#3) it is important to ask why they still are choosing fossil fuels.

## Significance of the Study
This analysis is timely and crucial for several reasons:

1. Climate Change Mitigation: Fossil fuel dependency drives global temperature increases. Evaluating the carbon footprint of energy sources aids in identifying sustainable alternatives. Additionally climate change is a clock that waits for no one, if not acted on soon it may be too late for future generations.

2. Cost-Effectiveness: Understanding the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) helps policymakers and investors make informed decisions regarding energy infrastructure.
Consumer Affordability: Energy prices vary based on subsidies, grid efficiency, and production costs. 

3. Analyzing price trends across regions highlights equity concerns and opportunities for cost reductions.

4. Technological Innovations: The declining costs of solar and wind energy and improvements in nuclear safety present new opportunities for reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

## Research Objectives
This study aims to:
1. Compare carbon emissions per megawatt-hour (MWh) across major energy sources.
2. Assess the cost efficiency of different energy technologies based on production and operational expenses.
3. Examine electricity pricing for consumers and its correlation with energy source distribution.
4. Identify policy interventions that can accelerate the adoption of sustainable energy solutions.
