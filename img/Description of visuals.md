### **3. Share of Energy Production by Renewable Type** *(REPR KPI)*

This pie chart breaks down the share of total energy production by each renewable type. Wind dominates the energy mix, while other sources like Wave have smaller shares. This insight can inform policy focus and investment to encourage a more diversified and sustainable energy portfolio. 


---

### **4. Initial Investment by Renewable Energy Type** *(LCOE KPI)*

This chart showcases the initial investment required for each type of renewable energy. Wind demands the largest upfront investment, while Wave is relatively more affordable. Understanding these costs is crucial for making informed decisions on future energy projects.


---

### **5. Gas Production by Country** *(EAR KPI)*

This visualization presents total gas production by country, serving as an indirect indicator of energy access. Higher production in countries like United States suggests greater access and infrastructure development, whereas lower consumption in Belarus may indicate limited access or affordability constraints.
